                        Hey there!
                        <br />
                        I am <span className="purple">Dhanasasidharan Dhanabal </span> hailing from <span className="purple"> TamilNadu, India.</span>
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I hold a <span className="purple">B.Tech </span> in <span className="purple">Information Technology</span><br />from Karpagam Institute of Technology, Coimbatore, TN.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Beyond my passion for coding and technology, I enjoy staying active and engaged in a variety of interests.
                        Whether it's <span className="purple">diving into exciting games</span>,
                        spending <span className="purple">quality time with family</span>, or exploring new places while <span className="purple">traveling</span>,
                        these activities keep me inspired and balanced.
                    </p>
